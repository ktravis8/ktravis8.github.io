                <p>
                    This is the Yale School of Art website, on this website functions as a wiki and a calendar for the students.
                    They are also able to edit and work on this website as a project.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Contrast: The website has a lot of contrast between the text and backgrounds, but 
                            it also has clashing colors that are bright and very distracting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repetition: The website does not repeat the same colors and the bottom of the page is nothing like the top of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alignment: The website is not centered, and it also has awkward horizontal alignment, making it extremely difficult to follow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proximity: The things that are important are grouped tgether, in the calendar for example and the navigation bar has all of the things you may need, but it is not consistently grouping like things across the entire website.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Contrast: W3 Schools has a very good design of colors and allows your eyes to easily understand the foreground vs the background.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Repetition: The website consistently uses the same size and color boxes in order to create consistency
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Proximity: all of the important things are grouped together and lead to one another, at the bottom it has all of the coding languages they
                            have information on, allowing you to choose whatever you need to work on.
